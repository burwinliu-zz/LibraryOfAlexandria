## The Problem
The Library of Alexandria was one of the most complicated libraries of its time. The amount of time it would have taken to find scrolls and books could take hours. Now imagine if the librarian could predict which books and scrolls the pateron wanted. The librarian could re arrange the book shelves to keep highly requested items closer to the main desk. This is the issue that the Library of Alexandria Minecraft AI wants to solve.
