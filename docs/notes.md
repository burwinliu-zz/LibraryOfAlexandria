Time to store items, (Low weight? Who cares how long to store -- vs high weight?)


More weight to retrieving items (cost to retrieving)
Space used ? maybe ... (moon shot)


optimized under some constraints -- probability and distribution about what user wants that is given, placing system optimized given distribution.

constraints satisfactions, costs assosciated to search, A* search, or Greedy Search.

Enviornment First. Objective function, mathmatically. Keep a single enviornment, line of chests (easier to denote everything that way, descide based on that)
    Reinforcement Learning vs Optimization -- Think about states -- what kind of algorithm to study? 

Section on goals -- environment + brute force, simple setup, how to run 

And weekly meeting time to schedule 



## Proposal
Enviornment, Line of chests

Problem -- fastest way to retrieve objects 

Environment 

Probability Distribution -- uniform distribution
