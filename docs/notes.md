Things TODO

1) Stochastic Chests; Setup the enviornment to fail sometimes to open certain chests
2) Store and save data to be later retrieved at given path file locations
3) A "simple" run that will benchmark our own run. Average all the "requests" and distribute items evenly in 
that distribution across chests
4) Better plot our data in scatterplots, Histograms, and Moving averages (avergage score of 10 runs for 
instance)
5) Create a display class to reload old runs and display them out in malmo
