# Proposal
## Overview
This is a Proposal page for our project: Library of Alexandria

## Summary
Our goal is to make an intelligent agent sort, move and retrieve various items in a preconstructed area. In terms of input, we will provide an enviornment to train the agent in, where it may place objects, and some command that will indicate the user's desires. The applications for this project is as follows: 
- First, we are creating an agent of convinience for players in the future -- if they so choose, providing them an easy way to sort through massive inventories in an intuitive manner
- Second, we are creating an agent that can model an intelligent agent, which may be used in real world applications, for retrieving items from an inventory in a warehouse for instance

## AI/ML Algorithm
As we are right now in the initial stages of development, we imagine we will be using NLP for retrieval and some form of a graph search to find locations for certain items

## Evaluation
Our metrics will include ...

Our qualitative analysis will depend on first completing basic tasks such as recieving items from chests in linear and strightforward scenarios ie. one chest few items. As our scope evolves we will also add the element of complexity in storage and recall tasks by the agent. To visualize our algorithim we will use plot devices and various search algorithims and we will also expirement with the level of complexity our agent can handle. Our moonshot case that could be interesting is recalling items and using them to speed up the search ie. first chest has an ender pearl so the agent throws it to get to its next search location faster.
