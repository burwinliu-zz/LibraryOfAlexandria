## Project Summary
The goal of our project is to train a Minecraft agent to navigate an environment consisting of a row of n chests and 1 goal chest to retrieve and store items in an efficient manner given a distribution of items. The distribution will be determined by a "simulated user" who will send retrieval and storage commands to the agent. The result of the retrieval commands will accumulate in the goal chest.  To do this the agent must optimize the placement of these items based on the retrieval requirements of the items. The final goal of this project would be to create an agent which can effectively store and retrieve items with the least amount of delays moving items around to optimize retrieval for each request.
## Approach
Our current approach is to take a Optimization based approach which we can optimize based on the probability distribution we are given.
